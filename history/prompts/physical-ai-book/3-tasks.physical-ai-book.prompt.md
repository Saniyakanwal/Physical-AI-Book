# Physical AI Book Tasks

## User Input

Generate a completed task log (as if all tasks are done) covering: - Scaffolding Docusaurus site - Writing 20+ Markdown/MDX chapters based on course outline - Implementing and embedding RAG chatbot - Adding authentication and personalization - Urdu translation functionality - Deployment configuration - Demo video preparation Output everything in clean, professional Markdown format suitable for inclusion in the repo as HISTORY.md, SPECS.md, PLAN.md, and TASKS.md.

## Response

I have successfully created a comprehensive task breakdown for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. The tasks.md file includes:

1. **Phase 1 - Setup**: Project initialization and basic structure setup with Docusaurus
2. **Phase 2 - Foundational**: Core infrastructure that blocks all user stories
3. **Phase 3 - User Story 1**: Student learning experience (MVP) with textbook and chatbot
4. **Phase 4 - User Story 2**: Personalized learning with authentication and user profiles
5. **Phase 5 - User Story 3**: Multilingual access with Urdu translation
6. **Phase 6 - Content Generation**: Writing all textbook chapters according to course outline
7. **Phase 7 - RAG Enhancement**: Advanced chatbot features
8. **Phase 8 - Deployment**: Setting up production deployment
9. **Phase 9 - Demo Preparation**: Creating demo materials
10. **Phase 10 - Polish**: Final improvements and cross-cutting concerns

The tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing, with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified. Each task follows the required format with checkboxes, IDs, story labels where appropriate, and specific file paths.

## Outcome

The tasks.md file has been created at specs/1-physical-ai-book/tasks.md with 88 specific, actionable tasks organized across 10 phases. The tasks follow the required format and are ready for implementation. Each user story can be developed and tested independently, with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.
