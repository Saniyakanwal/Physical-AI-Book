# 90-Second Demo Script: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## Introduction (0-15 seconds)
"Hi everyone! Today I'm excited to show you our revolutionary Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics book - an interactive learning platform that transforms how we understand robotics. This isn't just a static textbook; it's an intelligent system that adapts to each learner."

## Core Features Demo (15-45 seconds)
"See these buttons at the top? With 'Personalize for Me', the content adapts to your experience level, background, and learning preferences. And for our Urdu-speaking users - one click translates the entire technical chapter into formal, technical Urdu. This makes advanced robotics accessible to a global audience."

## RAG Chatbot Demo (45-70 seconds)
"Behind the scenes, we're using a RAG system powered by Qdrant vector database and OpenAI. When you ask questions about ROS 2 code or complex robotics concepts, the system finds relevant sections and provides intelligent answers. It's like having a robotics expert available 24/7."

## Subagents System (70-85 seconds)
"What makes this special is our subagent system - navigation, manipulation, and perception agents that work together to provide comprehensive answers. Each agent specializes in different robotics domains while collaborating seamlessly."

## Closing (85-90 seconds)
"This is education reimagined - personalized, multilingual, and intelligent. The future of technical learning is here. Let's build the next generation of roboticists together!"
