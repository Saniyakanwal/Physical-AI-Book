# Sample Chapter: Introduction to Physical AI

This is a sample chapter page that demonstrates how the chat interface component integrates with textbook content.

Physical AI is a field that combines artificial intelligence with physical systems, particularly robotics. It focuses on creating AI systems that can interact with and understand the physical world.

## Key Concepts

- **Embodiment**: AI systems that exist in and interact with the physical world
- **Sensorimotor Learning**: Learning through interaction with the environment
- **Real-world Reasoning**: AI that can reason about physical properties and constraints
