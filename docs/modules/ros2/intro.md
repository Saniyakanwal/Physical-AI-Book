# Introduction to ROS2

The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the fundamentals of ROS2 architecture
- Learn about nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Implement basic ROS2 programs
- Work with ROS2 tools for debugging and visualization

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of programming concepts
- Familiarity with command line interfaces
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

Let's dive into the world of ROS2!

## ROS2 Architecture Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the architecture of ROS2:
