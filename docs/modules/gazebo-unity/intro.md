# Introduction to Gazebo and Unity

## Overview
This module covers two of the most popular simulation environments for robotics: Gazebo and Unity. Both platforms offer powerful tools for simulating robots and their interactions with the environment.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, you will:
- Understand the fundamentals of robot simulation
- Learn to create and configure simulation environments in Gazebo
- Explore Unity's robotics toolkit for simulation
- Implement physics-based simulations for robot testing

## What is Robot Simulation?

Robot simulation is the process of creating a virtual environment where robots can be tested, trained, and validated before deployment in the real world. Simulation offers several advantages:

- **Safety**: Test dangerous scenarios without risk to hardware or humans
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Reduce the need for physical prototypes
- **Repeatability**: Run the same experiment multiple times with consistent conditions
- **Speed**: Accelerate development by running simulations faster than real-time
- **Variety**: Test in diverse environments that may be difficult to access physically

## Gazebo vs Unity for Robotics

### Gazebo
- Physics engine: ODE, Bullet, Simbody, DART
- Integration: Native ROS/ROS2 support
- Focus: Robotics research and development
- Strengths: Accurate physics, sensor simulation, large model database

### Unity
- Physics engine: NVIDIA PhysX
- Integration: Unity Robotics Package, ROS# bridge
- Focus: Game development with robotics applications
- Strengths: High-quality graphics, VR/AR support, large developer community

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ROS2 (from the previous module)
- Familiarity with 3D environments
- Basic programming skills
