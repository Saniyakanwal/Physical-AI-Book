# Capstone Project Ideas

## Overview
This section provides ideas for capstone projects that integrate multiple technologies covered in the course.

## Project Ideas

### 1. Autonomous Navigation Robot
Create a robot that can navigate autonomously in an unknown environment using:
- ROS2 for system integration
- Gazebo for simulation and testing
- NVIDIA Isaac for perception tasks
- VLA models for human-robot interaction

### 2. Humanoid Robot Control System
Develop a control system for a humanoid robot that:
- Uses ROS2 for low-level control
- Implements perception using Isaac ROS packages
- Integrates with VLA models for natural language commands
- Simulates in Unity or Gazebo

### 3. Assistive Robotics Application
Build an assistive robot application that:
- Understands natural language commands
- Perceives the environment using vision
- Navigates safely using ROS2 navigation stack
- Operates efficiently on Jetson hardware

### 4. Multi-Robot Coordination System
Design a system with multiple robots that:
- Coordinate using ROS2 multi-robot frameworks
- Share perception data using Isaac tools
- Respond to high-level commands using VLA models
- Operate in simulated and real environments

## Evaluation Criteria
- Technical complexity and integration of multiple technologies
- Innovation in approach or application
- Quality of implementation and documentation
- Demonstration of learning outcomes from the course
