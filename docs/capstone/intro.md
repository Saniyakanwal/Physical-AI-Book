# Capstone Project - Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Overview
The capstone project is designed to integrate all the concepts learned throughout the course into a comprehensive, real-world application. You will design, implement, and demonstrate a Physical AI system that incorporates multiple technologies covered in the course.

## Project Options
1. **ROS2-based Humanoid Robot Controller**: Develop a control system for a humanoid robot using ROS2
2. **Simulation-Based Robot Learning**: Create a learning system in Gazebo or Unity that enables a robot to perform complex tasks
3. **NVIDIA Isaac Application**: Build an application using the NVIDIA Isaac platform for a specific robotics challenge
4. **Vision-Language-Action Robot**: Implement a robot system that responds to visual and linguistic inputs to perform actions

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Synthesize knowledge from all course modules
- Apply Physical AI concepts to solve a complex problem
- Demonstrate proficiency with at least two of the technologies covered
- Present your solution effectively

## Timeline
- Week 11: Project proposal and planning
- Week 12: Implementation and testing
- Week 13: Final presentation and documentation
