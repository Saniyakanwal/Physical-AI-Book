# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clarity and Educational Excellence
Content must be beginner-friendly yet technically deep, bridging digital AI to embodied intelligence. All materials must prioritize clear explanations, visual aids, and progressive learning paths that guide students from foundational concepts to advanced implementations.

### II. Modular, Reusable, and AI-Driven Development
Using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code for efficient, maintainable development. All components, lessons, and modules must be designed for reusability, with clear interfaces that enable easy updates and modifications as technology evolves.

### III. High Interactivity
Support RAG chatbot, user personalization, and future extensibility. The textbook must incorporate interactive elements, hands-on exercises, and AI-powered assistance to enhance the learning experience and adapt to individual student needs.

### IV. Performance
Fast loading, mobile-friendly, accessible. All content and interactive features must perform efficiently across devices and network conditions, ensuring equitable access for all learners regardless of their hardware or connectivity limitations.

### V. Accuracy
All technical details on ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, VLA models, hardware requirements must be correct and up-to-date. Technical content must be verified against current documentation and best practices, with regular updates to maintain relevance as technologies evolve.

### VI. Inclusivity
Support Urdu translation and personalized learning paths. The textbook must be accessible to diverse learners, including those for whom English is not the primary language, and must accommodate different learning styles and backgrounds.

### VII. Open and Collaborative
Fully open-source, well-documented for community contribution. All code, content, and development processes must be transparent and accessible to encourage community participation, peer review, and continuous improvement.

## Technology Stack and Implementation Standards

The project follows the exact course outline provided: Quarter Overview, 4 Modules (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, Vision-Language-Action), Weekly Breakdown (Weeks 1-13), Capstone Project, Hardware Requirements, Learning Outcomes, and Assessments.

The textbook is built with Docusaurus and deployed on GitHub Pages, ensuring wide accessibility and maintainability. All interactive features, including the RAG chatbot and personalization engine, must integrate seamlessly with this stack.

## Development Workflow

All contributions must align with the core principles, undergo peer review, and include appropriate testing for both content accuracy and technical functionality. Changes to technical content must be validated against current ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and VLA model documentation.

## Governance

This constitution governs all development and content decisions for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. Amendments require documentation of rationale, community review, and approval by project maintainers. All PRs and reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
